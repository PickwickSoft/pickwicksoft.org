**Open Source Development**\
In the last 4 years I have constantly created and updated existing open source projects. Currently I am maintaining my most popular repository on GitHub pystreamapi. I am open sourcing as much as I can because open source is what powers the technological world!

- Setup and design of open source software.
- Implementation and testing of an innovative library for Python.
- Testing code and maintaining repository.
- Preparing code and resources for the community
- Documenting code with modern solutions
