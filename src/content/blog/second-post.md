1. **What is TensorFlow?:** TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a
   comprehensive ecosystem of tools and libraries for building and deploying machine learning models.

2. **Installing TensorFlow:** You can install TensorFlow using pip, Anaconda, or Docker. Follow the official
   installation guide to install the appropriate version of TensorFlow for your platform.

3. **TensorFlow Basics:** TensorFlow revolves around the concept of tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays. Learn
   how to create and manipulate tensors using TensorFlow's API.

4. **Building a Simple Neural Network:** Start with a simple example of building a neural network using TensorFlow's
   high-level Keras API. Train the model on a sample dataset, such as the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, to classify
   digits.

5. **Customizing Models:** Explore how to customize and configure neural network architectures, including adding layers,
   changing activation functions, and tweaking hyperparameters to improve model performance.

6. **Training and Evaluation:** Learn how to train your model using gradient descent optimization algorithms and
   evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

7. **Saving and Loading Models:** Once you've trained your model, learn how to save it to disk and load it later for
   inference on new data.

8. **TensorBoard Visualization:** Visualize your model's training progress and performance metrics using TensorBoard,
   TensorFlow's visualization toolkit.

9. **Transfer Learning:** Explore the concept of transfer learning, where you fine-tune pre-trained models on new
   datasets to leverage their learned representations for new tasks.

10. **Deploying TensorFlow Models:** Finally, learn how to deploy your TensorFlow models to production environments,
    whether it's on-premises or in the cloud, using frameworks like TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite.
