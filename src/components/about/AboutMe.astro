			I am a Romanian freelancer, open source developer and student living in Munich, Germany. In my
			over 5 years of experience in coding I have covered lots of technological areas from core
			libraries over Linux desktop applications to Web applications with modern web technologies. In
			my eyes being always informed about new developments in the technological world is important
			to ship good and efficient software. In my free time I love running, being out in the
			mountains and playing the guitar.
